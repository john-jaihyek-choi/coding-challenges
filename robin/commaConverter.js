// Sometimes, you may be too lazy to add a comma between 0s to separate every thousand. If you have your own converter that will just print out a number with commas in right position you'd be happy! Today, write a function that converts numeric strings to comma-separated strings. â€» However, do not use the money conversion library supported by the programming language.
// For example, 2000 --> 2,000 | -1224.10 --> -1,224.10

// Pseudocode:
// declare a function called formatNumber with a single parameter, num
// return the returned value of calling the replace method ofthe number obejct, passing in regex condition as an argument;

function commaConverter(number) {
    return number.replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, '$1,')
}
